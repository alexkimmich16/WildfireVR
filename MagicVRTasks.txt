TODO
PHASE 1 summary
-should be in a prototype state
no over the top animations, partical effects, shaders, objects, models lighting, or visuals of any kind
this should be a way to dictate what works and what doesn't in order to diagnose the project better
this can all be done within 3 weeks if time is used effectively

Magic ideology
theres a few ways to approch magic in this game, with the lack of concepts explored in the industry, it gives
us basic creative freedom in respect to the way spells are cast: the backbone of the game
ideas so far include:

TRIGGER DELMEMA
1)a motion, then press trigger to confirm, hold trigger to control it, release to activate
so a motion to summon a shield then press trigger, hold trigger to maintain the shield, release to let go
and release to stop shield
2)holding trigger while doing motion and preforming the spell and trigger release to preform the spell
3)NO trigger or grip whatsoever(this is possible with all magic, but will take longer, but could have a big payoff)

DO TRIGGER 1
TD = best trigger delmema solution for this magic

FORCEPUSH(TD 1 or 2)
-partical effect OR momentary shader
-spell
-deflector
-removes mana

SHIELDS(TD 1)
-shader
-spell
-deflector(blocks fireballs or 180 DEFLECTS THEM!!!)
-on/off(depends on trigger problem
-removes mana

FIREBALL(TD 1 or 2)
-motion
-partical effect
-wall collision
-movement after spawn(could be lobbed in a direction and fall down, just go straight, straight with pathfinding)
-damages player
-removes mana

SPIKE (TD 1)
-motion(DONE but sucks)
-removes mana
-partical effect(needs to be better)
-deflects fireballs(means it could be turned into a wall later on)
-better placement(perhaps a state where you look around to place spike with hologram, than place) 
(fireball can cut a hole in the ice, just a thought)

MULTIPLAYER:
-each has hitbox that can be hit by fireball
-each has health
-can see other player move arm and world position
-on health < 0, respawn
-each should be able see all fireballs, block all fireballs, see all shields, 

- ajusting for arm sizes(a menu at the start that you load in and measures your height and armlength forward and 
side to find a accurate path for magic)
-Deciding on best Trigger Demlema solution
I've made my own little game engine within unity that works by using buttons on the wall to record motions which i can explain later
